IDE:
I'm using IntelliJ, you should be able to import the project easily.

How to run:
In IDE:
    main class is: com.test.robots.App, run it and the logs will be print in Console,
    it can also be in a log file if config the folder location in log4j.properties

This is a maven project, to run it, change directory to project root folder and run command:
mvn package && java -jar target/robots.jar
